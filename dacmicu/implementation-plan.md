# DACMICU implementation plan for Pi

> **WARNING: This plan has been critically reviewed.** See [archive/research-2026-05-10-critical-plan-review.md](archive/research-2026-05-10-critical-plan-review.md) for a deliberately hostile reading that challenges every load-bearing assumption. Key findings: "deterministic" is overstated; reassessment step is unvalidated; evolve should be removed from v1; the "2-3 days" estimate is 3-5× too low. This page preserves the original plan for reference; consider the critique before building.

> The single-extension design previously committed here has been replaced by the modular six-package monorepo described in [modular-architecture](modular-architecture.md). This page now serves as the build sequencing plan against that architecture.

## Build sequence

**Updated 2026-05-08**: `@pi-dacmicu/subagent` is dropped (reuse tintinweb instead). Now five packages plus a meta-package, build in dependency order.

| Step | Package | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `@pi-dacmicu/base` | (Pi core only) | `pi -e ./packages/base` registers `signal_loop_success`; an `agent_end` listener attached via the exported `attachLoopDriver()` helper drives a manual test loop. |
| 2 | `@pi-dacmicu/todo` | base | TODO tool reconstructs from `getBranch()`; `/todo-loop` command activates driven mode; loop terminates on `unchecked == 0`; survives `/compact` via `session_before_compact`. |
| 3 | ~~`@pi-dacmicu/subagent`~~ | — | **DROPPED** (evening 2). Use `tintinweb/pi-subagents` via `pi.events`-RPC instead. LLM uses tintinweb's `Agent` tool (Claude Code-idiomatic name) directly; no DACMICU subagent tool. |
| 4 | `@pi-dacmicu/fabric` | (none) | `pi-callback` CLI installed on PATH; bash `tool_call` interceptor prepends `PI_CALLBACK_SOCKET=...` to commands; round-trip from a bash heredoc through socket back to `pi.sendMessage` works. |
| 5 | `@pi-dacmicu/ralph` | base; **soft-dep on `tintinweb/pi-subagents`** | `/ralph "<goal>"` command; per-iteration check optionally spawns a tintinweb subagent for fresh context via `subagents:rpc:spawn`; degrades to inline (Variant A) if tintinweb absent; LLM-emitted `ralph_done` tool ends the loop. |
| 6 | `@pi-dacmicu/evolve` | base; **soft-dep on `tintinweb/pi-subagents`** | New build (no validated upstream prototype). A 510-LOC draft exists locally but is untracked and unverified — see [verification audit](../research-2026-05-10-comprehensive-verification-audit.md) § Category 2. Tools (`init_experiment`, `run_experiment`, `log_experiment`, `signal_evolve_success`), git branch management, and `selection.md` ledger are designed from scratch. `agent_end` driver consumes base's `attachLoopDriver()`. JSONL transcript writer added for candidate inspection (works around Hopsken viewer's 500-char truncation). `HazAT/pi-interactive-subagents` integration deferred to v1.x. |

## What `@pi-dacmicu/base` exports

Two surfaces:

1. **Extension surface** (default-exported factory): registers `signal_loop_success` tool, wires up `session_before_compact` preservation, manages a session-scoped registry of attached loop drivers.
2. **Library surface** (named exports for consumers): runtime helpers consumers import to attach their own drivers.

```typescript
// packages/base/runtime.ts (sketch)

export interface LoopDriver {
  /** Predicate: should loop continue? Run on each agent_end. */
  shouldContinue(ctx: ExtensionContext): boolean | Promise<boolean>;
  /** Build the message that drives the next iteration. */
  buildIterationPrompt(ctx: ExtensionContext): { content: ContentPart[]; customType: string };
  /** Optional: extra system-prompt context to inject during loop. */
  systemPromptAddition?(ctx: ExtensionContext): string | undefined;
  /** Optional: custom compaction summary for session_before_compact. */
  compactionSummary?(ctx: ExtensionContext): string | undefined;
  /** Identifier used in appendEntry for state coordination. */
  driverId: string;
}

export function attachLoopDriver(pi: ExtensionAPI, driver: LoopDriver): () => void;
```

`attachLoopDriver` returns a detach function. Consumers (todo, ralph, evolve) call it once during their factory, register their own tools, and base handles `agent_end` orchestration centrally — guarding `ctx.hasPendingMessages()`, checking abort, calling `sendMessage({triggerTurn:true, deliverAs:"followUp"})`.

This consolidates the loop-driver pattern that is currently re-implemented per-extension in `pi-evolve.ts`, `kostyay/agent-stuff/loop.ts`, `tmustier/pi-ralph-wiggum`, and others.

## Hooks each package uses

| Hook | base | todo | fabric | ralph | evolve |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| `agent_end` | ✓ (orchestrator) | (via base) | | (via base) | (via base) |
| `before_agent_start` | ✓ (chains additions) | ✓ | | ✓ | ✓ |
| `session_before_compact` | ✓ (calls compactionSummary) | (via base) | | (via base) | (via base) |
| `session_start` / `session_tree` | | ✓ | ✓ (socket bind) | | ✓ |
| `session_shutdown` | ✓ (cleanup) | | ✓ (socket close) | | |
| `tool_call` (bash) | | | ✓ (env+timeout) | | |
| `pi.sendMessage(triggerTurn:true)` | ✓ (sole caller) | | | | |
| `pi.exec` | | | | | ✓ (git) |
| `pi.events.emit("subagents:rpc:spawn")` | | | | ✓ (RPC client) | ✓ (RPC client) |
| `pi.registerTool` | ✓ (`signal_loop_success`) | ✓ | | ✓ (`ralph_done`) | ✓ |
| `pi.registerCommand` | | ✓ (`/todo-loop`, `/todos`) | | ✓ (`/ralph`) | ✓ (`/evolve`) |

This matrix is normative: only `base` writes to `pi.sendMessage(triggerTurn:true)`, ensuring single-driver invariant.

## Reference implementations to lift from

| Source | What to take |
|---|---|
| `examples/extensions/pi-evolve.ts` | **WARNING: this is a DACMICU draft prototype (untracked, unverified), NOT an upstream reference.** The file does contain correct patterns for `agent_end` driver, `session_before_compact`, `before_agent_start`, `session_start`/`session_tree` rehydration, and `signal_evolve_success` breakout — but these were written BY the planning process, not discovered in upstream code. Use `mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/extensions/loop.ts` as the canonical production reference for the driver pattern instead. See [verification audit](../research-2026-05-10-comprehensive-verification-audit.md) § Category 2.
| `packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/todo.ts` | TODO tool with state in tool-result `details`, branching-safe via `getBranch()` reconstruction, `/todos` UI component. |
| `packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/subagent/index.ts` | Subprocess invocation (`pi --mode json -p --no-session`), event parsing (`message_end`, `tool_result_end`), inline rendering with Pi's exported components, single/parallel/chain modes, abort handling. |
| `packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/plan-mode/index.ts` | The `agent_end` → `sendMessage({triggerTurn:false})` interactive variant; useful for ralph's interactive confirm-before-continue. |
| `mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/extensions/loop.ts` (ecosystem) | `wasLastAssistantAborted` helper pattern (line 201-205), single-active-loop guard with confirm dialog (line 359). **Path corrected evening 4**: was `kostyay/agent-stuff/pi-extensions/loop.ts` — wrong both in author and path. |
| ~~`tmustier/pi-extensions/pi-ralph-wiggum`~~ | **REMOVED evening 4**. Wiki claimed pause/resume + max-iteration cap; verification showed neither exists in the repo. Keep only as a generic ralph-loop reference, not for these patterns. |
| `latent-variable/pi-auto-continue` (ecosystem) | `setTimeout(...)` defer trick (verified line 52-55) to let agent settle into idle before injecting next message. Subscribes `agent_end`, calls `pi.sendUserMessage(text)`. Hard cap of 100 iterations. Disables on `ctx.signal?.aborted` (Escape). |

## Open issues to resolve during build

| Issue | Resolution path |
|---|---|
| In-process subagent (`ctx.modelRegistry.stream()`) — unverified pattern | Build a 30-line proof in step 3 before committing to the variant. If unworkable, drop and offer subprocess only. |
| Per-turn `systemPrompt` injection cost | Measure on long evolve runs. If material, switch to `customType` message that compacts naturally. |
| Compaction-preservation prompt wording | Borrow from `pi-evolve.ts:486-505`; iterate on observed compaction outputs. |
| Cycle detection (LLM stuck without making progress) | Track per-iteration deltas in `appendEntry`; stop on N consecutive iterations without state change. Threshold N=3 to start. |
| Unix socket survival across `/reload` | Test against pi `session_start` reason `"reload"`; bind once per process, not per session start. |
| Ordering of multiple `tool_call` bash interceptors | Document chain order; fabric's interceptor should be idempotent (skip if `PI_CALLBACK_SOCKET` already set). |

## Estimated effort

> **CRITICAL REVIEW FINDING**: The original "2-3 days" estimate is 3-5× too low. See [archive/research-2026-05-10-critical-plan-review.md](archive/research-2026-05-10-critical-plan-review.md) § 10 for the full critique. The revised honest estimate is below.

**Original plan**: ~1,500 LOC across five packages. Claimed 2-3 days.

**Revised honest estimate**: ~1,400-1,600 LOC for v1 (base + todo + ralph + evolve + fabric). **2-4 weeks** for a proficient Pi extension developer, including integration testing, edge cases, and documentation. See User Response below for priority decisions.

| Package | Original LOC | Revised LOC | Revised Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| base | ~200 | ~150 | Internal module (not standalone package). `attachLoopDriver` + `signal_loop_success` + compaction preservation. |
| todo | ~250 | ~200 | Loop driver + widget + `/todo-loop`. **Reassessment optional (default: off)** — reduces complexity and token cost. |
| ~~subagent~~ | — | — | Dropped. |
| fabric | ~250 | ~250 | User confirmed: tried in opencode, wants it. Socket server + bash interceptor + CLI. |
| ralph | ~200 | ~150 | Thin wrapper around DACMICU base. Flexible: Variant A (in-session) or Variant B (subagent via tintinweb). |
| evolve | ~600 | ~600 | **User confirmed: key feature.** Build from scratch. MATS loop, git branches, `selection.md` ledger, Variant B via tintinweb. |
| **Total v1** | **~1,500** | **~1,350** | Plus ~10 LOC meta-package. |
| Reused via soft-deps | ~6,600 | ~6,600 | tintinweb/pi-subagents + tintinweb/pi-manage-todo-list. |

**Why the original "2-3 days" estimate was wrong**: It assumed "lift existing code" would be fast. But the existing code is either unverified drafts (pi-evolve.ts), demo-quality examples (todo.ts has no widget/loop driver), or ecosystem extensions with different semantics. Integration testing, `/fork`/`/compact`/`/reload` edge cases, and real TUI testing consume most of the time — not the initial code writing.

**Build priority**: `base` → `todo` → `fabric` → `ralph` → `evolve` → integration tests.

## User Response to Critical Review (2026-05-10)

The user reviewed the critical plan review and made three priority decisions:

1. **Ralph**: Keep as thin wrapper around DACMICU base. Must be flexible to run in-session (Variant A) or on top of configured subagent infrastructure (Variant B). Not a standalone reimplementation — leverage the shared loop driver.

2. **Evolve**: Keep. This is a key feature the user wants to build. The lack of an upstream prototype is acknowledged; it will be built from scratch consuming base's `attachLoopDriver()`.

3. **Fabric**: Keep. User has already tried FABRIC-style composition in opencode and confirmed it works well. Wants it in Pi.

These decisions override the critical review's recommendations to remove evolve and defer fabric. The risk warnings from the critique remain valid (subagent RPC stability, evolve LOC estimate, reassessment unvalidated) but the scope is what the user wants.

**Revised v1 scope**: base + todo + ralph + evolve + fabric. ~1,350 LOC. 2-4 weeks.
